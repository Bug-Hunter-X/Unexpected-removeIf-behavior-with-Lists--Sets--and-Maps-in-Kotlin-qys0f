This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to the `removeIf` function in Kotlin when used with mutable lists, sets, and maps.  The issue stems from the difference in how `removeIf` iterates and removes elements based on the underlying data structure.  The `BuggyRemoveIf.kt` file showcases the problem, and `CorrectedRemoveIf.kt` provides a solution or explanation for handling these differences.
